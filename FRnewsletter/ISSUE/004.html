        <h2>“Learning Chinese Characters with Drawings” Series Textbook Introduction</h2>
        <p>For those who learn Chinese, because the structure of Chinese characters is more complex, it takes more effort to learn reading and writing than listening and speaking. Therefore, the “Learning Chinese Characters with Drawings” Series Textbook takes the "Chinese Key image strategy teaching method" as the core, aiming to reduce the learning difficulties of Chinese learners.</p>
        <p>The “Learning Chinese Characters with Drawings” Series Textbook integrate character-based and word-based teaching modes. We sorted characters with the same components. Furthermore, we used these characters to compose words, expanding the scope to sentences and context, supporting reading and communication. The first step of using characters to compose words was to use the Chinese Key image strategy teaching method to learn the components and terms of Chinese characters.</p>
        <p>The Key image strategy teaching method provides Chinese character learners images based on keyword mnemonics, double coding theory, and refinement theory. The meaning of Chinese characters, in other words, through this image, learners can connect the shape and substance of Chinese characters simultaneously. In addition, the Key image strategy can assist in learning both traditional and simplified Chinese characters, offering learners the option to choose their preferred learning type.</p>
