        <h2>Cool English—A One-stop Website for English Learning</h2>
        <p>Cool English , an open educational resource (OER) website supported by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan, is developed by Dr. Chen and his team with many professors from the fields of teaching English for speakers of other language (TESOL), computer sciences, and digital learning. Cool English currently has four major sections to serve students from different educational stages, namely elementary school, junior high school, senior high school, and vocational high school. The original purpose of building Cool English was to provide students in rural areas with more free and interesting learning resources to further improve their English skills, but this website is now also open to the public for anyone who is interested in improving their English at any age and in any place. Anyone can register an account to freely explore and use the learning resources in this one-stop site to improve their English skills and knowledge.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To enhance learners’ English development, a wide variety of CALL theories and technologies are adopted to produce engaging learning materials in Cool English. For example, Cool English utilized automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology and text-to-speech (TTS) technology to respectively detect learners’ pronunciation errors and train their oral expression skills.</p>

        <p>In addition to the self-developed learning materials, Cool English also incorporates useful resources from another website(s) or companies, such as open-source videos from Voice of America (VOA) and authorized e-books from TCM, to enhance learners’ English listening, speaking, reading, vocabulary, and grammar. Videos and e-books from these sources were further processed with Chinese subtitles and TTS-based audio respectively for learners’ better use of these materials. To make English learning more engaging, different types of digital games, either developed by Cool English team or purchased/licensed from internet resources, are also included in Cool English.</p>

In addition to the learners, Cool English also has more than 20,000 teacher users now, who can manage their own classes to assign students their assignments, track their participation, and view their assignment scores via our website.</p>

        <h2>NTNU’s language technology makes teaching and learning more enjoyable, easy, and effective</h2>
        <p>NTNU Chinese Language and Technology Center (CLTC) has established a platform to measure learners’ Chinese reading and speaking abilities for Chinese language learners.</p>
        <hr>
        <div class="row my-4">
          <div class="col-11 col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-5 mx-auto"> <img src="../Content/images/002/2-1.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="SmartReading-Mandarin"/> </div>
        </div>
        <p>In order to allow Chinese learners to have a more convenient and professional Chinese reading platform, NTNU Chinese Language and Technology Center (CLTC) has established SmartReading-Mandarin. SmartReading-Mandarin is a Chinese adaptive reading platform designed for learners who learn Chinese as a second language or foreign language, providing learners with an interesting Chinese reading journey. Learners can choose different learning tracks according to their own Chinese proficiency, learn Chinese reading and earn reading experience points as rewards.</p>
        <div class="row mb-4">
          <div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-8 col-xxl-7 mx-auto"> <img src="../Content/images/002/2-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt=""/> </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>What SmartReading-Mandarin can do for you</h3>
        <p>The platform of SmartReading-Mandarin provides many e-books written by professional teaching teams on the reading platform. In addition to grading vocabulary marking, there are also audiobook functions available. Chinese learners improve their Chinese reading ability in a relaxed and interesting way. </p>

            <h3>Learn how we discover the readability of a book</h3>
            <p>We employ AI technology to analyze a large number of books from different fields and different levels of difficulty, establishing the SR score which is the readability of a book. SR-Mandarin has leveled thousands of books’ readability, including Simplified and Traditional Chinese books. The larger the SR score is, the more difficult a book is. DACC-Mandarin can provide the reading proficiency of a Chinese language learner, and SR-Mandarin can provide the SR of a book. Users can refer to the description of each level to judge their reading ability and choose the books that suit them. According to the reading ability diagnosis results, learners choose Chinese e-books suitable for their reading ability—the e-books on this platform cover all reading texts at the Chinese level. The SR core can be mapped to the Chinese proficiency level according to the European Union CEFR and the American ACTFL. While the learners are reading the e-books, they provide the interpretation of the words and add post-reading tests to test their understanding of the contents of the reading.</p>

        </div>
        <p>SmartPinyin is a pedagogical and diagnostic platform for Mandarin listening and pronunciation that provides immediate diagnosis and feedback for Chinese language learners' listening and speaking skills, allowing learners to lay the foundation of listening and speaking without being restricted by time and space in order to improve their Chinese language skills. Our platform also provides adaptive listening and pronunciation courses, allowing learners to practice repeatedly, enhance speech perception, and correct pronunciation.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why You Should Use SmartPinyin</h3>
        <p>It's always said that Chinese listening and speaking of tone are the two most difficult skills for learners to learn by themselves. On the other hand, considering the limitations of curriculum planning and teaching time, the time spent by Chinese teachers in teaching pronunciation and listening cannot meet the needs of individual students. With the aid of SmartPinyin, it provides an individualized learning platform, making both teaching and learning more interesting, easy, and effective.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What we offer</h3>
        <p>Diagnostic feedback and training lessons on initials, finals, and tones in Chinese are provided.</p>
